        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 20px; color: #ffffff;">Project Title: Job Connect â€“ Website for Co-Workers 
<br><br>
Description:
The Co-Workers Website is a job-matching platform designed to help daily wage workers such as mistris, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled laborers find employment opportunities more easily. Traditionally, such workers stand on roadsides waiting for contractors or individuals to hire them, which leads to traffic congestion and inefficiency.

This project provides a digital solution by connecting workers directly with potential employers. Through the website, employers can search for available workers, view their details, and contact them directly with job addresses. Workers benefit from increased visibility and direct job opportunities without needing to physically wait in crowded areas.
<br><br>
Key Features:<br>

- registration with personal and professional details.
<br>
- and filter options for employers to find suitable workers.
<br>
- call or contact option with job address sharing.
<br>
- management of workers and employers using MySQL.
<br>
- powered by PHP with a user-friendly interface.
<br>
- roadside congestion and provides a more systematic hiring process.</p>
